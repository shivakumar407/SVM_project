# SVM_project
THIS IS SMALL PROJECT (SVM ) SUPPORT VECTOR MECHINE AND I TAKEN A DATASET OF (IRIS) AND CHECKED ACCURACY SCORE OF DATA_SET 
* Topic: The notebook is focused on Support Vector Machines (SVMs), a popular supervised learning algorithm used for classification and regression. This is evident from the notebook's title ("svm (support vector machine).ipynb").
 * Programming Language: The code is written in Python, as indicated by the "JupyterLab Python 3" label in the top right corner.
 * Environment: The notebook is running in a Jupyter environment accessed through a web browser, as seen by the "localhost:8888" URL.
Code Snippets and Analysis:
 * Data Loading: The first code block ("[27]") shows the loading of a dataset. It appears to be the Iris dataset, a classic dataset used for classification tasks. We can see the columns "SepalLengthCm", "SepalWidthCm", "PetalLengthCm", "PetalWidthCm", and "Species". The first few rows show data points belonging to the "Iris-setosa" species.
 * Data Splitting: The second code block ("[32]") splits the dataset into training and testing sets using train_test_split from the sklearn.model_selection library. This is a crucial step in machine learning to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data. 80% of the data is used for training, and 20% for testing.
 * SVM Model Training: The third code block ("[33]") trains an SVM model using the SVC class from the sklearn.svm library. The model uses the Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel, a common choice for non-linear classification. The parameters C=1.0 and gamma='scale' are also set.
 * Model Prediction: The fourth code block ("[34]") uses the trained SVM model to make predictions on the test set (x_test) using svm_model.predict(x_test). The predictions are stored in the y_pred variable.
Observations and Potential Improvements:
 * Basic SVM Implementation: The notebook demonstrates a basic implementation of SVM for classification using the Iris dataset.
 * No Evaluation: The notebook currently only trains the model and makes predictions. It lacks any evaluation metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score) to assess the model's performance. Adding these would provide a more complete analysis.
 * Hyperparameter Tuning: The SVM model uses default or manually set hyperparameters (C and gamma). Hyperparameter tuning techniques like grid search or cross-validation could be used to find optimal parameter values for better performance.
 * Visualization: The notebook lacks visualizations of the data or the decision boundaries of the SVM model. Visualizations can provide valuable insights and aid in understanding the model's behavior.
Overall:
This Jupyter Notebook provides a starting point for building an SVM classifier using the Iris dataset. It demonstrates the basic steps of data loading, splitting, model training, and prediction. To make it a more comprehensive machine learning project, further evaluation, hyperparameter tuning, and visualization would be beneficial.
